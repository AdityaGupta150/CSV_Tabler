#Contact_Star

The Problem- I had many contacts on mobile that actually were of freinds of my father (i didnt remove since there were relatives too), and now with my contacts they mixed up.

This is a small project aimed at reducing the size of a big contact list to a small but of those contacts with whom we are still in contact (It gives choice to keep which, no ML stuff). It takes a .csv file. As of now, to make it suitable for your use, you may have to edit it.
